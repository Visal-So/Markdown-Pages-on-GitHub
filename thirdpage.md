## **Travel**
#### The first place I ever been to after I got to America was _San Francisco_. It was so cool seeing the Golden gate for the first time. I've always wanted to go there ever since I saw it on movies. Not only that we also went to Silicon Valley as well. We went and take pictures at, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Intel, eBay, etc. The only place we didn't went to was the alcatraz island. I'm planning to go there with my friends someday. Back then I didn't know about the island at all but now I have a lot of knowledge about it.

#### I love traveling, I think I been around 70% of the United State. I went to Mainz and eat lobster there, their lobsters are some the best lobsters I ever eaten. I went to Las Vegas and it was so beautiful at night. It look ugly during day time though. I went to Grand Canyon, Galveston beach, New york City to see the statue of liberty, etc. The only place that I want to see but haven't have the chance to do so is _Mount Rushmore_.
