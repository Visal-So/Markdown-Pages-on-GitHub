## **Travel**
#### The first place I ever been to after I got to America was _San Francisco_. It was so cool seeing the Golden gate for the first time. I've always wanted to go there ever since I saw it on movies. Not only that we also went to Silicon Valley as well. We went and take pictures at, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Intel, eBay, etc. The only place we didn't went to was the alcatraz island. I'm planning to go there with my friends someday. Back then I didn't know about the island at all but now I have a lot of knowledge about it.
