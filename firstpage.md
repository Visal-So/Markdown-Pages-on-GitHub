# High School (Torrance High School)
#### My parent orignal plan was for me to start school in the fall because it was too late for me to start anyways since there's only two months left in the year. But I ended up going to school anyway because I told them I can use this last two months to make some friends. I was in seventh grade in back at my country but here, they said that I should be a freshman at my current age. In my country, the student don't move from classes to classes whenever the bell ring. The teachers are the one who move from classes to classes when the bell rings. Since the system in America is different I was having a hard time adjusting to it. I took forever to find my next class and they only gave you seven mins. Everything else is about the same as it was at my country.

# High School (Macon High School)
#### High School in was a lot different in Torrance. The student there are so nice but when they're not in school they're like a different person. The school system is exactly the same as Torrance high but the people are completely different. In Torrance I can actually tell the type of person that person is going to be but in Macon I can't do that. Some of the people that I believe to be the nicest I ever met turn out to be something else. The teachers there are great though, they're way better than Torrance teachers. My science teacher and my senior math teacher are some of the best people I ever met. I don't know if they're different too when they're not at work but I hope not. That town is weird. I also do sports and I also learn some programming there as well. I would say my favorite year is my senior year. I met my two best friend during that year in my Geography class. Those are the only one (beside my family) I would ride or die with.
