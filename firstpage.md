# HighSchool
#### My parent orignal plan was for me to start school in the fall because it was too late for me to start anyways since there's only two months left in the year. But I ended up going to school anyway because I told them I can use this last two months to make some friends. I was in seventh grade in back at my country but here, they said that I should be a freshman at my current age. In my country, the student don't move from classes to classes whenever the bell ring. The teachers are the one who move from classes to classes when the bell rings. Since the system in America is different I was having a hard time adjusting to it. I took forever to find my next class and they only gave you seven mins.
