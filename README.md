# My Experience in America
#### Hi my name is _Visal So_. I was born in Cambodia, Phnom Penh, and I move to America about six years ago. At the time I lived in a town called Torrance in California. I live there for about 8 months and then we moved to Macon, Missouri. When I first got to America, everything was so different. You guys have free way, motorcycle are rarely seen, the sports are different, and the technology are more advance. The one things that I will always remember was my first day of high school. Below are the links to all of my stories in America:
