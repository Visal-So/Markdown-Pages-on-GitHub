# My Expirience in America
#### Hi my name is _Visal So_. I was born in Cambodia, Phnom Penh, and I move to America about six years ago. At the time I lived in a town called Torrance in California. I live there for about 8 months and then we moved to Macon, Missouri. When I first got to America, everything was so different. You guys have free way, motorcycle are rarely seen, the technology are more advance, and the people was so nice.
