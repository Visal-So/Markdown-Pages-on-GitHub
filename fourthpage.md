## Sports
#### I play two sports during my high school years, Soccer and Track. Soccer was really fun but our team suck! It gets to the point where I only go to practice just to chills with my friends. Track on the other hand was a workout. It was really difficult at first because I didn't expect the coach to make us go through all those stuff. Track was also fun as well but it was tough. These are all the events I participate:
* 100m dash
* 200m dash
* Long Jump
* High Jump
#### I also did a one mile run as well but after that one time I told coach to get me the hell out of there. I came in dead last and my leg feel like a jelly. In my senior year I decided to not do track, but one of my buddies told me "_if you do track in your senior year, you will get a poster_". After I heard that I decided that I gotta have that poster no matter what it take. Right now that poster is on the wall back at my parent house.
