## Macon
#### The reason why we move here is because my parent want to open up a donut shop and the one in Macon, Mo, is one those we can afford. When I first got to Macon, Mo, everything was so different. I was against my parent about moving there because Missouri doesn't have the sea. I love going to the sea, I went there every weekend in CA. Macon make me feel like I was at Cambodia. As times went on I started to get used to it and before I even realize it, I don't really care where I live anymore.
