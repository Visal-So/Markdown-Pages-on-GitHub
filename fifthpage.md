## College
#### I was always wanted to go to Mizzou, but I didn't do very well on the ACT test, so I decided to take the other approche. Since I have my A+ I can go to a community college for two years to get my Associate then I can transfer to Mizzou. By doing that I can go to college for two years without costing any money at all.
